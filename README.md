CPSC 349 - Web Front-End Engineering
Exercise 1
What are we trying to accomplish?
In this exercise, we will be familiar with HTML elements by creating a personal website.
Overview
1. The content is up to you, but I expect it to be tasteful! Describe yourself and tell us
something that interests you. Perhaps give a recipe you enjoy, a favorite movie or
hobby, a book you have read more than once!
2. Your site should have two or three pages, and these pages should be linked so that a
visitor can reach all of the pages on your site.
3. You need to have at least 30 different HTML elements.
4. You will use an on-line HTML validator to verify that your webpages are
correct. Screenshots of the validator report are part of your submission.
5. To complete the assignment, submit to Canvas your HTML files, screen shots from the
Validator, and the link to your deployed site (in a little text document).
6. Note: For this assignment, do not include any styling or scripting on your site, only
HTML.
Getting Started
A. You can write your webpages using your favorite text editor.
o Create a directory on your computer, then add your HTML files to this directory.
o Be sure that your 'main' file is called index.html.
o You can view your results by double-clicking one of the html files. Your computer
should start up your web browser, then render your page(s).
B. When you are done with a page, validate your work using an on-line HTML validator:
Capture a screenshot of the results, which will be part of your submission. Save these
images as PNG files.
C. To post your pages on the web, you may want to use Netlify or Github Pages as
described in class.
